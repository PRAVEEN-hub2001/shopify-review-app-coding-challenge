### Challenges faced
- I faced challenges integrating Shopify‚Äôs Storefront API with my Remix app, particularly with setting up a proxy for secure API calls. Since I‚Äôm new to Remix but have experience with web apps, I referred to Shopify and Remix documentation. I learned to use Remix loaders for server-side API calls, which helped avoid CORS issues and secure my credentials. I also got familiar with Shopify's GraphQL queries to fetch the necessary data and successfully integrate the API.
